## üöÄ Features

* **PDF Text Extraction**: Upload and extract text from PDF files.
* **Summarization Techniques**:

  * *Abstractive Summarization*: Utilizes the T5 Transformer model to generate human-like summaries.
  * *Extractive Summarization*: Employs TF-IDF to select key sentences from the text.
* **Text-to-Speech Conversion**:

  * Standard TTS using Coqui TTS.
  * Character-based voices.
  * Voice cloning with YourTTS.
* **Interactive Web Interface**: Built with Streamlit for user-friendly interaction.
* **Audio Playback and Download**: Listen to or download the generated audio summaries.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.7 or higher
* pip package manager

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PatelShashank477/PDF-Lexitone.git
   cd PDF-Lexitone
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate        # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   If a `requirements.txt` file is present:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Otherwise, manually install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install streamlit PyPDF2 nltk TTS transformers torch
   ```

4. **Download NLTK Tokenizer Data**:

   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   ```

## üß™ Usage

1. **Launch the Streamlit Application**:

   ```bash
   streamlit run test_streamlit.py
   ```

2. **Interact with the Application**:

   * Upload a PDF file.
   * Choose the summarization method: *Abstractive (T5)* or *Extractive (TF-IDF)*.
   * Select the desired voice output: *Standard TTS*, *Character Voice*, or *YourTTS Clone*.
   * Play or download the generated audio summary.

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

* **Streamlit App Not Launching**:

  * Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly.
  * Verify that you're using Python 3.7 or higher.

* **NLTK Errors**:

  * Make sure you've downloaded the necessary tokenizer data:

    ```python
    import nltk
    nltk.download('punkt')
    ```

* **Audio Not Playing**:

  * Check for errors related to `torch` or `TTS` installations.
  * Ensure your system supports audio playback.
